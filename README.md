# Expand World Prefabs

Server side scripting engine to easily create custom interactions.

Install on the server (modding [guide](https://youtu.be/L9ljm2eKLrk)).

## Features

Endless possibilities:

- Build immersive, reactive gameplay with custom interactions, events, and progression.
- Create custom objects and creatures with unique behaviors and abilities.
- Spice up regular game play with new challenges, rewards, and surprises.

## Configuration

Config file `expand_world_prefabs.cfg` is created automatically when the game is started. It has advanced settings that don't have to be changed for normal usage.

- Automatic file reload: If disabled, script files won't be automatically reloaded when changed.
  - This might be needed if the server host constantly triggers file changes.
  - You can use command `ewp_reload` to manually reload the script files.
  - You can use command `ewp_reload_data` to manually reload the storage file.
- Restore scale: If disabled, EWP no longer supports scaling of some non-scalable objects (like creatures).
  - This can be disabled if there already is a client side mod that enables scaling for all objects.
- Object attaching: If disabled, EWP no longer supports attaching objects to other objects.
- Server side data: If disabled, EWP no longer supports server side only data.
  - Server side data is just regular data, but prefixed with `ewp_`.
  - This reduces network traffic because the data is not sent to clients.
- Rule logging: If disabled, `log` actions stop adding records to `expand_world/logs/`.
  - Existing records are kept when the game is restarted.
  - Records per second (default: `1000`): Maximum refill rate shared by all rules.
  - Records per rule per second (default: `250`): Maximum refill rate for one rule, shared by all objects.
  - Flush interval milliseconds (default: `1000`): How often pending records are flushed.
  - Rate and flush settings require restarting the game. The enable setting can be changed while running.
- Persist spawned players: If disabled, EWP no longer supports persisting EWP spawned players.
- NPC player list range: Maximum distance for NPC profiles to appear in the player list. Set to 0 to disable this feature.
  - This is required for NPC chat, because clients only accept chat messages from players on the player list.
  - Note that the player count also scales some boss drops.
- Custom prefab names: Comma separated list of prefab names that are processed even when server doesn't recognize them.
  - This might be needed if there are modded prefabs that are not registered in ZNetScene.
  - The prefab names must be exact match, including capitalization.

Script file `expand_world/expand_prefabs.yaml` is created automatically. It starts empty, which means the mod doesn't initially do anything.

You can have multiple script files with names `expand_prefabs_*.yaml`. This is useful to organize scripts and also makes it easy to get files from other people.

Script files support [data system](https://github.com/JereKuusela/valheim-world_edit_commands/blob/main/README_data.md) of World Edit Commands. You can freely mix scripts, data and values in the same file.

Storage file `expand_world/ewp_data.yaml` is created automatically if custom keys are saved. This is meant work like global keys but these are never sent to clients.

### Item data

Item and container data use the Deep North save format. Existing item fields and inventory rules are converted automatically. See [Item data](docs/scripting.md#item-data) for details.

Legacy `strings` entries for `items` and `<string_items>` snapshots remain supported. Use `bytes` for new serialized-inventory data. A blank legacy `items,` entry clears the inventory.

### Biome filters

`biomes` and `bannedBiomes` accept base and alternate biome names. Use command `ewp_biomes` after loading a world to list the alternate names. `<biome>` returns the alternate names at the object, or the base name when none are present. See [Filters](docs/scripting.md#filters) for details.

```yaml
- prefab: Player
  type: create
  biomes: Kalhygge Black Forest
  log: "<biome>"
```

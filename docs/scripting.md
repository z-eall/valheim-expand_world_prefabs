# Scripting

Most fields are put on a single line. List values are separated by `,`.

- prefab: List of affected object ids.
  - Wildcard `*` can be used for partial matches. For example `Trophy*` to match all trophies.
  - Value groups can be used ([data system](https://github.com/JereKuusela/valheim-world_edit_commands/blob/main/README_data.md#multiple-parameter-values)).
    - By default, each object component has its own value group. For example `Tameable` or `Piece`.
    - By default, keywords `creature` (Humanoid) and `structure` (WearNTear) have their own value group.
    - By default, each build cost resource has its own value group. For example `material_Wood` or `material_Stone`.
      - The "Material" tab of the build menu lists the available names.
    - By default, each item type has its own value group. For example `itemtype_Consumable` or `itemtype_OneHandedWeapon`.

      - Use command `ewp_itemtype` to list the available `itemtype_*` value groups.
    - Values from groups are cached, so the prefab yaml must be manually saved when changing an already used value group.
- excludePrefab: List of excluded object ids.
  - This can be used to skip specific objects when a wildcard or component is used in the `prefab` field.
- type: Type of the trigger and parameter (`type, parameter1 parameter2`).
  - Parameters are optional and can be used to specify the trigger.
  - Parameters supports numeric ranges (`min;max`) and multiple values (`value1,value2`).
  - Supported types are:
    - `create`: When objects are created. No parameter.
    - `destroy`: When objects are destroyed. No parameter.
    - `change`: When objects data changes.
      - First parameter is the data name.
      - Second parameter is the data value.
      - Third parameter is the previous data value.
      - If the data value has spaces, it will be split into multiple parameters.
    - `state`: When objects broadcast a state change with RPC. First parameter is the state name. Second parameter is the state value.
      - This is more performant than `change` but supports only specific situations.
      - Recommended to check ([states](### State)) and use this if possible.
    - `say`: When objects or players say something. Parameter is the text.
      - Using this type automatically adds a server client to the player list.
      - Server client is needed to intercept chat messages.
      - Server client counts as an extra player for boss kills, increasing the amount of loot.
    - `command`: Deprecated. Use `say` with `admin: true` instead.
    - `poke`: When `pokes` field is used.
      - [Basic Discord Guide](https://discord.com/channels/1167153871546744842/1366020389905629264), [Advanced Discord Guide](https://discord.com/channels/1167153871546744842/1366022688275173550)
    - `globalkey`: When a global key is set or removed. Parameter is the key name.
      - Use field `remove` to trigger on key removal.
      - There is no prefab or position for this type, so most fields won't work.
    - `key`: When a custom saved data is set or removed. Parameter is the data name.
      - Use field `remove` to trigger on data removal.
      - This only triggers when the saved data actually changes.
      - There is no prefab or position for this type, so most fields won't work.
    - `custom`: Manual custom event. Can be only triggered by custom code.
      - See [API documentation](developers.md) for more info.
      - There is no prefab for this type, so most fields won't work.
    - `event`: When an event starts or ends. Parameter is the event name.
      - Use field `end` to trigger on event end.
      - There is no prefab for this type, so most fields won't work.
    - `time`: When the time changes.
      - First parameter is the granularity (day, hour, minute, tick).
      - Second parameter is the condition (single value, multiple values, range).
      - Note: Valheim day is 30 minutes, Valheim hour is 1.25 minutes, Valheim minute is 1.25 seconds.
      - [Discord Guide](https://discord.com/channels/1167153871546744842/1360994829663867040)
    - `realtime`: When the real-world time changes.
      - First parameter is the granularity (day, hour, minute, second).
      - Second parameter is the condition (single value, multiple values, range).
      - Uses server timezone.
    - `config`: When a setting declared with a `config` entry changes (see [config](config.md)).
      - Parameters are the section, the name and the new value. Rule parameters filter by section and name, for example `type: config Bosses bossHealth`.
      - Wildcards work, for example `config Bosses *`. The new value is available as `<par2>`.
      - Old value isn't provided.
      - Also triggers on external edits of the config file.
      - Changes made by rules triggered by this type don't trigger `config` again.
      - There is no prefab or position for this type, so most fields won't work.
  - Objects spawned or removed by this mod won't trigger `create` or `destroy`.
- types: List of types.
- chance (default: `1`): Chance to execute this entry when all filters match.
  - This can be combined with weight and is checked after weight selection.
- weight (optional): When set, only one of the weighted entries is selected.
  - All weights are summed and the probability is `weight / sum`.
  - Sum is at least 1, so with low weights there is a chance to not select anything.
- fallback (default: `false`): If true, this entry can only get selected if no other entries match.

## Filters

If a filter is not specified, it's not checked and is always considered valid.

All valid entries will be executed in unspecified order. Weight system can be used trigger only one entry.

- condition: Free-form expression. Requires using [functions](functions.md) to retrieve values.
  - Valid if resolves to non-empty and non-zero value.
  - Versatile, allowing to combine many other filters.
  - Logical operators can be used to compare values, returning either true or false.
  - Operators must be separated by spaces to be recognized.
  - Evaluation order can be changed with parentheses. For example `(a and b) or c`.
  - Supported operators are:
    - `and`: Checks if both sides are valid.
    - `or`: Checks if at least one side is valid.
    - `not`: Checks if the side is not valid.
    - `xor`: Checks if exactly one side is valid.
    - `in`: Checks if the left side is contained in the right side (comma separated list).
    - `not in`: Checks if the left side is not contained in the right side (comma separated list).
    - `=`: Checks if both sides are equal.
    - `!=`: Checks if both sides are not equal.
    - `>`: Checks if the left side is greater than the right side.
    - `<`: Checks if the left side is less than the right side.
    - `>=`: Checks if the left side is greater than or equal to the right side.
    - `<=`: Checks if the left side is less than or equal to the right side.
- admin: Checks if the object owner is an admin.
  - If true, the owner must be an admin.
  - If false, the owner must not be an admin.
  - If not set, nothing is checked.
- biomes: List of valid biomes.
  - Accepts base and alternate biome names, separated by commas. Names are case insensitive.
  - A base biome includes its alternate biomes. An alternate name only matches sectors with that alternate biome.
  - Multiple names match any listed biome. For example `biomes: Meadows, Kalhygge Black Forest`.
  - Use command `ewp_biomes` after loading a world to list the exact alternate names. Use these names rather than translated map labels.
- bannedBiomes: List of invalid biomes.
  - Accepts the same names as `biomes`. Any matching base or alternate biome blocks the rule, including when another alternate biome also matches.
- day: Valid during the day.
- night: Valid during the night.
- minDistance: Minimum distance from the world center.
- maxDistance: Maximum distance from the world center.

- minTerrainHeight: Minimum original terrain height (y coordinate).
  - Terrain modifications are not included.
- maxTerrainHeight: Maximum original terrain height (y coordinate).
- paint: Valid terrain paint color.

  - The terrain must be exactly the same color.
- minPaint: Minimum terrain paint color.
  - Each terrain color component must be same or higher.
- maxPaint: Maximum terrain paint color.
  - Each terrain color component must be same or lower.
- environments: List of valid environments.
- bannedEnvironments: List of invalid environments.
- globalKeys: List of global keys that must be set.
  - The values are converted to lower case because the game always uses lower case.
- bannedGlobalKeys: List of global keys that must not be set.
  - The values are converted to lower case because the game always uses lower case.
- keys: List of saved custom data that must be set.
  - The values are converted to lower case to match global keys behavior.
  - Format is `key1 value1, key2 value2, ...`.
  - Value can be a range `min;max;step` for integers (step defaults 1 if not given).
- bannedKeys: List of saved custom data that must not be set.
  - The values are converted to lower case to match global keys behavior.
  - Format is `key1 value1, key2 value2, ...`.
  - Value can be a range `min;max;step` for integers (step defaults 1 if not given).
- locations: List of location ids. At least one must be nearby.
- locationDistance (default: `0` meters): Search distance for nearby locations.
  - If 0, uses the location exterior radius.
  - This also affects banned locations, unless `bannedLocationDistance` is set.
- bannedLocations: List of location ids. None must be nearby.
- bannedLocationDistance (default: `0` meters): Search distance for nearby banned locations.
  - If 0, uses the location exterior radius.
- events: List of event ids. At least one must be active nearby.
  - If set without `eventDistance`, the search distance is 100 meters.
- eventDistance: Search distance for nearby events.
  - If set without `events`, any nearby event is valid.
- playerEvents: List of event ids. At least one must be possible for the player.
  - The list depends on the player progression (killed enemies, known items, taken Forsaken powers).
  - The list is created even when player based events are not enabled.
  - You can use the parameter `<pdata_possibleEvents>` to print them.
- bannedPlayerEvents: List of event ids. None must be possible for the player.
- groups: List og groups. Player must be in at least one of these groups.
  - Requires using Server Devcommands mod or some other mod that provides group implementation.
- bannedGroups: List of groups. Player must not be in any of these groups.

### Data filters

Filtering can be done based on object's data.

- filter: Data filter that must match.
- bannedFilter: Data filter that must not match.

Filters can be either data entries or single data values.

This works for some cases, but if feels difficult can be more straight forward to use `condition`.

Format for a single data value is `type, key, value`. Supported types are bool, float, hash, int, quat, string and vec.

```yaml
# This data entry must match.
filter: coinStack
# Creature must be a boss.
filter: bool, boss, true
# Creature must have 1-2 stars.
filter: int, level, 2;3
# Pet name must contain "(S)".
filter: string, TamedName, *(S)*
# This data entry must NOT match.
bannedFilter: hasTakenDamage
# Creature must NOT be named "Piggy".
bannedFilter: string, Humanoid.m_name, Piggy
```

For type `repair`, the filter is also checked for the player who did the repair. Filter is valid if either the player or the object matches.

Containers can be filtered by items. This is done by using "items" from a data entry.

- If item amount is not set, then the items must match exactly.
- If item amount is set, then at least that many items must match.
- Items are checked in the same order as they are defined in the "items" list.
- If item amount is set but items are not, then only the item count is checked.

### Multiple filters

There can be multiple required filters and banned filters. By default, each required filter and no banned filter must match.

Format for a data entry is `name, weight`, with weight being optional.

Format for a single data value is `type, key, value, weight`, with weight being optional.

- filterLimit: Can be used to change how many filters must match.
  - Default limit is the amount of required filters.
- filters: List of required data filters.
  - Matching filters count positively towards the limit.
  - Default weight is 1, which means all filters must match to reach the default limit.
- bannedFilters: List of banned data filters.
  - Banned filters count negatively towards the limit.
  - Default weight is 10000, which causes any matching filter to fail the default limit.

```yaml
# Matches when a player is wearing at least 2 pieces of the bronze armor.
filterLimit: 2
filters: 
# Bronze helmet counts as 2 pieces.
- hash, HelmetItem, HelmetBronze, 2
- hash, ChestItem, ArmorBronzeChest
- hash, LegsItem, ArmorBronzeLegs
# The player must not be wearing any iron armor.
bannedFilters:
- hash, HelmetItem, HelmetIron
- hash, ChestItem, ArmorIronChest
- hash, LegsItem, ArmorIronLegs
```

### Object filters

- objectsLimit: How many of the `objects` must match (`min` or `min;max`).
  - If not set, then each entry must be found at least once. One object can match multiple filters.
  - If set, that many entries must be found. Each filter can be matched by multiple entries.
  - When using max, all objects must be searched.
- objects: List of required nearby objects.
  - prefab: Target object id or value group.
  - self: When set to true, the object itself is included in the search.
  - minDistance: Minimum distance to the object.
  - maxDistance: Maximum distance to the object. Default is 100 meters.
    - All objects are searched if the max distance is more than 10000 meters.
  - minHeight: Minimum height difference to the object.
  - maxHeight: Maximum height difference to the object.
  - condition: Optional condition expression. Must evaluate to true for the object.
  - weight: How much this object counts towards the `objectsLimit`. Default is 1.
  - offset: Position offset in x,z,y from the original object position and rotation.  
  - Data filters like `filter`, `filters`, `bannedFilter` and `bannedFilters` can be used to filter the object.
- bannedObjectsLimit: How many of the `bannedObjects` must not match (`min` or `min;max`).
  - If not set, then all of the entries must not be found.
  - If set, that many `bannedObjects` must not be found. Each filter can be matched by multiple entries.
  - When using max, all objects must be searched.
- bannedObjects: List of banned nearby objects.

See object filtering [examples](examples_object_filtering.md).

### Actions

- addItems: Data entry that is used to add items to the container object.
  - Data type "items" is used for this.
  - If the item exists, its stack amount is increased up to the max.
  - Remaining stack amount is added as new items.
  - For adding a single item, shorthand `itemid, amount` can be used.
- cancel (default: `false`): If true, the RPC call of the triggering action is cancelled.
  - This affects types `command`, `damage`, `say`, `state` and `repair`.
  - This only works properly for some actions, since the RPC calls are usually for cosmetic changes.
  - For example chat messages can be cancelled so that they are never shown to other players (for example for non-admin custom commands).
- command: Console command to run.
  - Functions are supported.
  - Using `say` command requires either Discord Control mod or Server Devcommands mod (with Server chat enabled).
- commands: List of console commands to run.
- log: Text appended as a new record in `BepInEx/config/expand_world/logs/ewp_log.txt`, or a list of strings / structured `log` and optional `logFile` items for separate records.
  - Functions and object substitutions are supported.
  - Logging is server-authoritative and occurs after rule selection and chance checks, before other configured actions.
  - Logging records that the rule reached its action phase; it does not prove that later actions succeeded.
  - Existing text is appended; complete records rotate into numbered archives at the configured size limit.
  - The previous root-level `expand_world/ewp_log.txt` is left untouched; new output goes to `logs/`.
  - The `Rule logging` configuration setting can disable all `log` actions without changing scripts.
  - One background worker buffers writes and flushes about every second or at 64 KiB; it never performs file I/O on the rule's caller.
  - Rate, memory and record-size limits protect gameplay. Rejected records are counted in throttled gap summaries.
  - An I/O failure disables only the affected destination until restart; a throwing formatter disables that message until YAML reload.
  - Defaults retain four 256 MiB segments per named log, including the active file. There is no shared folder-size cap.
  - See [rule logging](logging.md) for examples and operational notes.
- logFile: Comma-separated destination names, inherited by log items unless explicitly replaced. Message text is resolved once for all copies.
  - Names are lowercased and use 1–64 ASCII letters, numbers, underscores or hyphens; EWP adds `.txt`.
  - Duplicate destinations are removed. Paths, extensions and reserved device names are rejected.
- data: Sets object data either with format `name` or `type, key, value`.
  - Format `name` can be used to set multiple values (entry name from `data.yaml`).
  - Format `type, key, value` is a shorthand to set a single data value.
  - If a component field is set, the object is respawned to apply the changes.
  - Otherwise the data is force pushed to clients, which can override local changes (such as creature movement).
- injectData: If set, overrides the default logic for data changes.
  - When false, the object is always respawned (even when component fields are not changed).
  - When true, the object is never respawned (even when component fields are changed).
  - Only use this if really needed, the default logic works for most cases.
- drops: If true, the object drops are spawned.
  - These include creature drops, destructible drops and structure materials.
  - This can also be a data entry with `items` information.
  - Not supported for type `destroy`.
- exec: Runs functions with side effects.
  - Mostly useful for saving custom data with the `save` function.
- owner: Changes the object owner (number).
  - Only works when using `injectData: true`.
  - Number 0 removes the owner, but the server will reassign it after a few seconds.
- remove (default: `false`): If true, the original object is removed.
- removeDelay: Delay in seconds for remove.
- removeItems: Data entry that is used to removes items from the container object.
  - Data type "items" is used for this.
  - If the item doesn't exist then nothing happens.
  - For removing a single item, shorthand `itemid, amount` can be used.
- triggerRules (default: `false`): If true, spawns or remove from this entry can trigger other entries.
- connect: Connects this object to another object.
  - This can be done by passing `<zdo>` as poke parameter.
  - Connections allow direct poking.
- attach:: Attaches this object to another object.
  - This can be done by passing `<zdo>` as poke parameter.
  - Attaching is SyncTransform connection, so it can also be used for direct poking.
  - Attaching makes the object follow the other object (requires ZSyncTransform component).
  - Attaching disablesthe object by forcing it non-owned. This is required to keep the attachment working.

### Spawns

- spawn: Spawns another object.
  - prefab: Object id or value group.
  - condition: Optional condition expression. Must evaluate to true for this spawn attempt.
  - data: Entry in the `data.yaml` to be used as initial data.
    - Supports `type, key, value` format to set a single data value.
  - pos: Position offset in `x, z, y` from the original object.
    - Polar format `distance, angle, y` is supported when angle ends with `deg` or `rad`.
  - snap: If true, the spawned object is snapped to the original terrain height.
    - Terrain modifications are not checked.
    - Some objects don't have the origin point at the bottom, so they may appear slightly inside the terrain.
    - Position offset can be used to move the object up or down after snap.
  - rot: Rotation offset in y,x,z from the original object.
  - triggerRules: If true, this spawn can trigger other entries.
  - chance (default: `1`): Chance to spawn the object.
  - weight (optional): When set, only one of the weighted spawns is selected.
    - All weights are summed and the probability is `weight / sum`.
    - Sum is at least 1, so with low weights there is a chance to not spawn anything.
  - delay: Delay in seconds for spawning.
  - removeDelay: Delay in seconds before automatically removing the spawned object.
  - repeat (default: `0`): How many times the spawn is repeated.
  - repeatInterval (default: `0`): Interval in seconds between repeats.
  - repeatChance (default: `1`): Chance to spawn for each attempt (including the original).
  - owner: Overrides the default initial owner assignment. For example with `<owner>` function.
  - connect: Connects the spawned object to another object. See Actions for more info.
  - attach: Attaches the spawned object to another object. See Actions for more info.
- swap: Swaps the original object with another object.
  - Format and keywords are same as for `spawn`.
  - The initial data is copied from the original object.
  - Swap is done by removing the original object and spawning the swapped object.
  - If the swapped object is not valid, the original object is still removed.
  - Swapping can break ZDO connection, so spawn points may respawn even when the creature is alive.
  - Chance works for swap too. If it fails, the original object is still removed.
  - Note: Swapping creatures can cause high amount of creatures because spawn limits are based on the amount of the original creature.

### Pokes

Poking allows to trigger actions on other objects (or even on the original object).

- poke: List of poke objects:
  - prefab: Target object id or value group.
    - By default, the object itself can't be poked. You can set `self` to true allow self poking.
  - self: When set to true, the object itself can be poked.
    - If prefab is set, then other filters must apply as usual.
    - If prefab is not set, then the object itself is always poked.
  - target: Specific ZDO object. This can't be used with prefab.
  - connected: When set to true, includes objects that are connected to the original object.
    - For other way, use `target: <connected>`.
  - pars: Parameters for the `poke` type.
    - Format is `par0, par1, par2, ...`.
    - Structure is strictly defined. Parameter values with commas won't cause additional parameters.
  - parameter: Old way to specify the poke parameter.
    - Format is `par0 par1 par2 ...`.
    - Structure is dynamic, Parameter values with spaces will cause additional parameters.
  - evaluate: If false, math expressions are not calculated in the parameter. Default is true.
    - For example if some text has math symbols, it might cause weird results.
    - Math expression are considered legacy, use [functions](Functions) instead.
  - chance (default: `1`): Chance to poke.
  - weight (optional): When set, only one of the weighted pokes is selected.
    - All weights are summed and the probability is `weight / sum`.
    - Sum is at least 1, so with low weights there is a chance to not poke anything.
  - delay: Delay in seconds for poking.
    - When server side data is enabled, the pending poke is saved to the object's server-side data.
    - This allows the poke to trigger even after restarting the server.
    - Note: This doesn't work if parameters include object ids, because after restart the ids are regenerated.
  - repeat (default: `0`): How many times the poke is repeated.
  - repeatInterval (default: `0`): Interval in seconds between repeats.
  - repeatChance (default: `1`): Chance to poke for each attempt (including the original).
  - limit: Maximum amount of poked objects. If not set, all matching objects are poked.
  - random: If true, the poked objects are selected randomly. If false, the closest objects are pokeda.
  - minDistance: Minimum distance from the poker.
  - maxDistance: Maximum distance from the poker. Default is 100 meters.
    - If you need to poke something far away, try to use `target`, `position` or `offset` instead.
    - Global triggers don't have any object, so the distance is from the world center (0,0,0).
  - minHeight: Minimum height difference from the poker.
  - maxHeight: Maximum height difference from the poker.
  - position: Absolute position in x,z,y to override the original object position.
  - offset: Position offset in x,z,y from the original object position and rotation.
  - Data filters like `filter`, `filters`, `bannedFilter` and `bannedFilters` can be used to filter the affected objects.

### RPCs

RPC calls are way to send data to clients. Usually these are used by clients but server can call them too.

Check possible RPCs in [RPC documentation](RPCs.md).

- objectRpc: List of RPC calls. The RPC must be related to the triggering object.
- clientRpc: List of RPC calls. These calls are not related to any object.

RPC format:

- name: Name of the RPC call. Must be exact match.
  - See list of supported calls: (RPCs.md)
- target: Target of the RPC call. Default is `owner`.
  - `owner`: The RPC is sent to the owner of the object.
  - `all`: The RPC is sent to all clients.
  - ZDO id: The RPC is sent to the owner of this ZDO.
    - Functions are supported. For example `<zdo>` can be useful.
- chance (default: `1`): Chance to trigger.
- weight (optional): When set, only one of the weighted RPCs is selected.
  - All weights are summed and the probability is `weight / sum`.
  - Sum is at least 1, so with low weights there is a chance to not trigger anything.
- delay: Delay in seconds for the RPC call.
- repeat (default: `0`): How many times the RPC is repeated.
- repeatInterval (default: `0`): Interval in seconds between repeats.
- repeatChance (default: `1`): Chance to trigger for each attempt (including the original).
- overwrite (default: `false`): If true, the RPC call overwrites any existing delayed calls with same name and target.
  - This is useful for messages so that only the last one is shown.
- source: ZDO id. The RPC call is faked to be from owner of this ZDO.
  - Functions are supported. For example `<zdo>` can be useful.
- packaged: If true, the parameters are sent as a package. Default is false.
  - This must be set to true for some RPC calls.
- 1: First parameter.
- 2: Second parameter.
- 3: Third parameter.
- ...: More parameters.

### Item data

- Container data is packed to `items` byte arrays.
  - Old string based `items` data is automatically loaded from the byte array.
- Item data is packed to `itemData` byte arrays.
  - Old separate data values are automatically loaded from the packed item data.
  - These include `durability`, `stack`, `quality`, `variant`, `crafterID`, `crafterName`, `worldLevel` and `pickedUp`.
- Game only shows crafter name if crafter ID is nonzero.
  - Crafter ID is automatically set to value `1` when only a crafter name is provided.

### Terrain

- terrain: List of terrain operations.
  - Missing _TerrainCompiler objects are automatically created when needed.
  - Doesn't apply to zones that are not already generated.

Terrain operation:

- delay (default: `0`): Delay in seconds for the terrain change.
- pos (or `position`): Position offset in x,z,y from the original object. Default is no offset.
- resetRadius (default: `0`): Radius for the terrain and paint reset.
  - This is purely done server side, so you can't use other operations with this.
- square (default: `false`): If true, uses a square shape for level, raise and smooth changes.
- levelRadius (default: `0`): Radius for the level change. A positive value enables leveling.
- levelOffset (default: `0`): Vertical offset for the level change.
- raiseRadius (default: `0`): Radius for the raise change. A positive value enables raising.
- raisePower (default: `0`): Power of the raise falloff.
- raiseDelta (default: `0`): Delta for the raise change.
- smoothRadius (default: `0`): Radius for the smooth change. A positive value enables smoothing.
- smoothPower (default: `0`): Power of the smooth falloff.

### Functions

Functions can be used to retrieve values from the object or the game.

Additionally functions can be used to combine values (for example addition or multiplication).

See [functions](functions.md) for more information.

### Hacks

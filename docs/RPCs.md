# Expand World Prefabs: RPCs

RPCs provide a way to call client code from the server.

## Data types

Complex data types are defined as spacebar separated key-pair values.

Currently hit data is the only complex data type.

### Hit data

For example `1: hit, fire=20 blunt=50`.

Options:

- damage: Raw damage that ignores resistances and armor.
- blunt: Amount of blunt damage (float)
- slash: Amount of slash damage (float)
- pierce: Amount of pierce damage (float)
- chop: Amount of chop damage (float)
- pickaxe: Amount of pickaxe damage (float)
- fire: Amount of fire damage (float)
- frost: Amount of frost damage (float)
- lightning: Amount of lightning damage (float)
- poison: Amount of poison damage (float)
- spirit: Amount of spirit damage (float)
- tier: Tool tier (int)
- force: Knockback force (float)
- backstab: Backstab multiplier (float)
- stagger: Stagger multiplier (float)
- dodge: Can be dodged? (bool)
. block: Can be blocked? (bool)
- dir: Direction of the hit (vec)
- ranged: Is ranged attack? (bool)
- attacker: Attacker ZDO id (zdo)
- pvp: Ignores PvP setting? (bool)
- pos: Position of the hit (vec)
- status: Status effect (string)
- skill: Skill level for status effect (float)
- level: Item level for status effect (int)
- world: World level tier (int)
- type: Hit type, used for player stats if dying to this hit (string)
  - Undefined, EnemyHit, PlayerHit, Fall, Drowning, Burning, Freezing, Poisoned
  - Water, Smoke, EdgeOfWorld, Impact, Cart, Tree, Self, Structural, Turret, Boat, Stalagtite
- spot: Index of Weak spot (int)

## Object RPCs

This list all RPC calls related to some object.

By default, the RPC is sent to the owner of the object.

- Most calls check for ZDO ownership. Using `all` would just increase the network traffic without any effect.
- Calls with `all` can be used just with `owner` too, but this might not show all visual effects to the clients.
- Calls with `all` can be replaced with a player poke that uses `owner` to only target the nearby clients.
- Calls with `<zdo>` require custom handling to get proper ZDO id. The RPC is sent to owner of this ZDO.
